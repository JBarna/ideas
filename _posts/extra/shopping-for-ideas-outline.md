- Intro
- - If Donald and Hillary are so repugnant, why did they get the majority of the votes?
- - The "Shop" method, check for ideas that you like, pick one
- - The research + logical method, understand the underlying data, make your own decision about a conclusion

- The "Shop" method, how does it work?
- - (intro) Example of selecting a political candidate
- - What are you using to select the conclusion you want if you aren't doing the logical work?
- - You are most likely relying on other factors that are not themselves logical
- - The feeling you have towards the speaker, their credentails, their background, the way they talk
- - These are "trust factors"
- - (weak) These feelings most likely come from your upbringing and what you identify with or you like for whatever reason (maybe)
- - Our identity and subscribed conclusions entangle as there is no other underlying mechanism, like logic, that we can point to as reasons for our conclusions
- - This is done subconciously 

- What implications does using the "shop" method have when discussing topics with others?
- - When others challenge our ideas we take personal offense to this because our identity is coorelated with our ideas. If someone disagress with your opinion, they've disagreed in some essense with your very being. 
- - There is no shared way of discussing the differences in the approach to reach the conclusion because the decision was not conciously rational in nature.
- - (recognize positive path but don't dive in ) The only way to reconcile your differences is to become introspective and ask yourself why you came to your conclusions, go back to the starting block, and try again rationally.
- - Without introspection and overcoming our deffences, we simply categorize every other person as an "other", since we don't know why we choose the way we do and the way they do. We just know we're different.

- How this affects our interaction with social groups
- - Our attachments to these groups are based on intangible ideas and are thus correlated with our identify and feelings, creating a tribe like feeling. 
- - This "otherization" creates social groups and ideologies that form not based on the ideas but based on the underlying factors that people used to choose their ideas
- - These underlying factors may be things like race, culture, who we trusted growing up, etc. 
- - This could explain why there is substaintial division along those lines and why ideologies are commonly grouped with "isms"

- How logical shortcuts are just as bad
- - So going back to square one, why not just become educated in these subjects?
- - As previously discussed - this means listening to good media sources
- - But don't fall into the trap of thinking that you can just "identify" intellectual sources
- - Surely an averagly intelligent person can identify a nutjob spouting off crazy conslusions, but are we using shortcuts to identify conclusions based on how intellectual or well thoughtout or common sensical someone is?

- Story time of the physics story
- - The takeaway, if you are an expert, that means you should be able to do the actual rational work to reach the same conclusion, not be "smarter" at identifing if conclusions sound good or smell rotten
- - For the rest of us, if this type of human bias can affect experts, about a topic in their domain, about a conclusion that a different expert had, what does that say about our ability to identify conclusions based on the "rational" indicators of another "expert"?
- - - Basically.... we can't
- - (tie in to earlier, not sure how to make this work) We now see ourselves as intellectual, so if we subscribe to ideas based on what we identify as smart ideas, then we see everyone else as stupid.**

- First, how do we navigate this landscape going forward?
- - How necessary is it to have opinions on these topics?
- - - Do they actually have a direct influence on you?
- - - Ask yourself the hard question of if you didn't participate, would anything in your direct surroundling life change?
- - - Even if they do affect remotely affect you, how often? We only vote once every few years. 
- - - Do you have to pick a side all the time?
- - Either abstain or use concious compartamentalization to carefully become aware and make choices when necessary
- - Abstain from participating in topics that don't directly affect you
- - Be a responsible consumer of media,
- - - try to get as many different perspectives as possible, don't jump to conclusions
- - - Make a decision to just be aware. Aware of different perspectives. There is value and comfort in awareness without aligning to sides
- - Understand and compartamentlize when you actually do have to take sides
- - - What to do when it comes time to vote?
- - - Compartamentlize your decision, realize it's without full thought, and keep your identity away from it

- Second, learn how to navigate and identify situations in the moment
- - Identify sources of jumping to conclusions or tribal behavior
- - - People who "otherize" will push you to pick a group, or say that you're still the problem.
- - - I argue that you are in fact conciously choosing to not fall down that pitfall of jumping to a conclusion, and in fact you are maintaining your level of intellectual discipline
- - - When others try and force you into making a decision, realize it as a friend who has a gambling or eating problem and wants to drag someone else in. Have sympathy but stay away
- - Train yourself to recognize when you are becoming defense of preconceieved beliefs that you may have accumulated
- - - Being willing to break down our own identity and be honest with our honest inclinations
- - - Being willing to unsubcribe to ideas that we've had previously
- - - Being able to take the highground and become introspective and not defensive
- - - Rememeber, This is about your own journey of finding truth, not about whos right and wrong
- - - Does holding onto this opinion or feeling really matter to my everyday?

- Conclusion
- - We have a choice for which path we want to go down, which wolf to feed
- - We can hold onto our intellectual discipline by choosing what we focus on
- - We can always abstain from a particular convesation, or walk away
- - We can treat people with humanity and ask them "why" until they become introspective
- - We can try to be more comfortable having direct 1-1 conversations with others, as this removes the tribal element and we have a better chance of realizing we're more alike than different
