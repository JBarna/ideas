# Online Intellectualism and the fishbowl of unchallenged expert ideas

# Online Intellectualism and the fishbowl of unchallenged expert ideas

### Organization - the outline (notes) and logical connections of the post
- There are lots of expert opinions online which are availabe through many mediums, but mostly they are presented from a single expert without active debate or comparison with another expert in real time
- - Ranges from innocent and non-trivial topics to complex but innocent topics, to complex and controversial topics
- - Compared with the level of access to expert information prior to the internet, this level of access to domain knowledge experts is incredible.
- - - This should be great, right?
- - Many different mediums available to find this content
- - - Podcasts, explainatory videos by experts, youtube channels, online articles, dedicated websites / blog posts, etc
- 
- What are the problems with this?
- 1. Interviewer isn't knowledgable enough to ask challenging questions and represent another viewpoint
- 2. The experts who would be knowledgable enough to ask these questions are not present in the conversation
- 3. No way to see how the different perspectives actually mesh when put together because the listener doesn't have the domain  knowledge necessary to compare and contrast the ideas
- 
- Why are people listening to the podcasts?
- - Most individuals are not actively listening and continuosly critiquing the information they are hearing.
- - Is it fair to assume Podcasts should even be judged against providing this type of information?
- - The podcasts themselves don't promise expert-vetted information, they promise other things
- - Even if they do, is that a product they can provide?
- 
- Case Studies of Podcasts discussing COVID-19
- - London Real
- - Valuetainment
- - Joe Rogan
- - All-in Podcast
- 
- Questions that popped out once the can was openned
- - Are podcasts a good medium for discussing and presenting important and complex topics to the ordinary person?
- - What are people actually using podcasts for?
- - - To learn about new intellectual concepts that help them construct their own opinions?
- - - For entertainment purposes?
- - - To help their drive to work go better?
- - What is the indended purpose of podcasts?
- - - What is their marketing?
- - - What is the actual product? (and how do they differ?)
- - If we reach the conclusion that podcasts aren't the best medium from which to form our opinions about important topics that impact our life, what is?
- - - And how do we reconcile that we want to understand the world around us and feel like we understand and have sophisticated perspectives, even though it's impossible for us all to become experts on all of the complicated subjects that impact our life?
- 
- Maybe we are being to soft on the listener
- - They have some responsibility here if they want to learn multiple perspectives
- - Just listen to a different expert or different perspective
- - - These topics can be so domain knowledge intensive that even if the listener did listen to multiple perspectives, they cannot compare and contract effectively to reach a conclusion through the messsy middle
- 
- So what's the conclusion?
- - With podcasting in its current state (lex fridman)
- - - Best - listener hears one perspective, understands it (or does the work to), and then actively persues other perspectives, understands those, and is able to reconcile those differences to reach a conclusion
- - - Worst - Listener only hears one perspective, doesn't understand the details, doesn't look up other perspectives, hears the conclusion of the perspective and subscribes to it or subconciously subscribes to it
- - - Most likely - Listener hears one perspective, may understand parts of it, doens't immediately subscribe to the conclusion but picks it up as a viable option that may later influence their perspectives
- - What does that look like if there are multiple experts debating?
- - - Best - Understands multiple perspectives exist and understands the differences between the two, is led to make their own conclusion based on the complex soup of information
- - - Worst - Doesn't take away any domain knoweldge from the conversation as it is too confusing and is unable to derive a simple conclusion. Only understands that the topic is confusing and people have differnet opinions
- - - Most likely - Understands multiple perspectives exist, may understand some of the domain knowledge, understands where the disagreements are in the fundamentals that lead to the conclusions, and understand the multiple conslusions that exist. The listner may choose to subscribe to a conclusion that they were convinced by, or they may think the arguments at the disagreement were not convincing enough and not choose to reside with a conclusion. 

- Remaining questions
- - How do people learn, and how helpful is podcasting in that endeavour?
- - When people subscribe to ideas / conslusions that they haven't fully thought through, does that negatively affect their identity?
- - Is it a problem for society if massive amounts of people are listening to a podcast that isn't built in a way to present information in a structured and comparitive way that people can make their own decisions, and the medium of the information exchange doesn't help that either?

### What prompted this post
We live in a world where experts regularly share their expert opinions about certain topics online - through blog posts, interviews, podcasts, youtube videos, or any number of the available online mediums for information. From innocent topics from favorite music, to controversial topics such as COVID-19 and the science behind it, you can find many online experts having conversations about these topics, dropping their expert wisdom and expert hot-takes about these subjects to an ever growing open eared audience of normal (but smart!) people, who ideally will be able to filter and process all of these opinions and remarks into their own coherent understanding of the world and topic being addressed by these experts.

This is great, right? We live in a world with sugh priveldged access to these individuals that we can directly hear their opinion, and don't have to take the word of whatever the mainstream narrative is, or just go with our gut, or just go with the opinion of someone that we look up to as being smart because we don't have a better option. In a lot of ways, being able to listen to these experts is really something incredble compared to the access to information that was available to the mass public prior to the internet.

However, I have a few problems with this. The main challenge with the current situation online is that these experts are 1. not being interviewed by another relative expert that can ask thought-provoking questions which challenge their assumptions, and bring the truth to a better light, and 2. the other experts who have differing opinions are not there to present a different perspective and 3. There is no way to actually see how the different perspectives mash together and connect on their fundamental differences and assumptions because the other expert isn't there in person to actually have a debate.

The reality is that most poeple are not actively listening to these podcasts and doing the work to compare and contrast the opinions of other experts with the current expert, and then break down their differences, and see the discrepencies. And is that their job? This is a podcast afterall - a passive audio experience that is usually played in the background of another activity, or listened to for entertainment similiar to an audio book. The medium by which the information is presented has as default bias toward acceptance of the material, not scrutency. 

To illustrate this point better, imagine that rather than listening to a podcast you were reading the transcript of the conversation. As anyone who has read knows, it takes active energy to process the text and contextualize it with the flow of the conversation. When logical infallacies arise, or just general confusion, the mind kicks in and raises a flag. This happens more naturally in an activity where the consumer must input energy, such as reading (the book doesn't read to you), compared with an audio broadcast (such as a podcast, or an audio-book), where the information comes at you in a continouos manner and it's easy for your mind to simply absorb the information rather than track along with every sentence. Not to mention that when listening to a conversation, the actual content of the discussion is much less organized than content such as an edited book, which adds to the difficultly of continously tracking the logical line of points about the topics.

Let's compare 3 different podcasts to represent some different approaches that podcast hosts present, and see what we can learn from them.

1. London Real

The London Real show took a very interesting turn during the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, as Brian Rose, the host, had on some very controversial guests who disagreed directly with the mainstream narrative, and challenged the power of authierities openly. The unique characteristics of the London Real interview style is that Brian Rose barely does any moderation of the conversation. His perspective is that the guest has so much powerful content to share that he doesn't want to get in the way. He wants to be an avid listener and see how much he can learn from his guest - an admirable perspective, regardless of how negative the consequences ended up being. 

In addition to the lack of moderation by Brian Rose, the show also hosted guests that were not credentialed in anyway by the relative scientific institutions they were discussing, which by itself does not make the words that the guest was saying false, but certainly most would agree that they should be more scruitinized by the public (and the moderator) when differing opinions and perspectives arise.

If you are familiar with the London Real story, then you know that London Real had multiple shows with guests removed from Youtube, and came dangerously close to becoming fully deplatformed from all of social media. There is a fully legitamate discussion to be had around if London Real had its freespeech violated, however that is not the point of this article. The point of this article is if the show, the host, the style of interaction between two, and the credentials (or lack there-of) of the guest, contributes to a discussion that listeners can be confident in the integredity and validity of. This leads us to the question, if everyone is just shouting opinions, how can we be sure of which opinions to be listening to? And is the goal of the podcast to just present perspectives, or credible perspectives, or multiple credible perspectives compared with each-other?

Perhaps the reality is that the podcast's goal isn't either of those things, it's just to be interesting entertainment that listeners will subscribe to. Even if that means marketing the podcast as representing one of the goals previously listed, while the reality is just entertainment. And like I said, it's hard to disagree with the reality that their show doesn't perform if they don't get people, but as previously discussed, people are passively listening to these shows, and like most passive activities, we're looking for some generic form of entertainment. So does the fault lie with the show, the listener, is it both, or is it just a result of the medium by which the information is being passed through (passive-audio)

2. Valuetainment
As a direct comparison to the London Real show, Valuetainment had an interview with the afformentioned controversial guest that lasted over 2 hours. The behavioral style of David-Bet Patrick, the host, and the guest was significantly different than that of the London Real show. The host interrupted continuously throughout the conversation with his guest, and provided counter points or challenging questions to dig into the claims being made by the guest. While David-Bet Patrick is also not an expert, and the guest is also not an expert, a listener to the show would be confronted with a discussion that represented that the perspective of the guest is not unchallenged, and the listener cannot possibly listen to the show in the entiretly and take away only a single perspective. The concept of a difference of opinion or perspective is built-in through the interaction that the host provides.

3. Joe Rogan
- similiar to value tainment
- attempts to learn about the concepts and ask provoking and interesting questions of the guest
- Has on credentialed guests (for covid at least)
- Has on multiple guests with different perspectives (but not at the same time)

4. The All-in Podcast
- Not experts on everything they discuss, but they do discuss investing / VC and they are experts in those areas
- Actively disagree with eachother in real-time
- Give the audience multiple perspectives to view the topic from
- Discuss topics that they aren't experts in (China, Macroeconomics, etc)

=> Expert disagreements? 
=> Find the episode of Richard Duncan and Robert Kyrosaki

-----------------
I think there are a few takeaways and conflicting ideas here
- What are podcasts for?
-- Who is their intended audience?
-- Do people actually use podcasts for what their marketed reason is for? As in, do people actually learn from them, or just absorb material and ideas without critical thought?
-- Is their medium well suited for this endevaour?

- Do podcasts do a good job at presenting differing expert opinions and their intersection?

You can argue that the purpose of podcasts aren't to give this type of leveled, logical, and comparative type of expert opinions. As Joe Rogan stated recently, his Podcast was never meant to be more than just talking with people he thought would be interesting to talk to, he doesn't have a plan when he sits down. it's just a conversation.

And I think that's fair - there are a lot of podcasts out there and they all have different objectives ranging from silly to enterntaining to serious to fictional. However it presents a challenge for the listener who does want a detailed and overviewed perspective

-----------------
When it does come down to it, what are people listening for? Are they listening because they really want to know the truth? Are they listening for entertainment? Are they listening because they themselves want to become an expert? Perhaps it's too much to assume that people should be getting high quality information from podcasts when they are really just tuning in to hear a conversation that represents a sophisticated perspective that gives them some enjoyment.

I think the challenge though is that these podcasts switch between silly and funny episodes to very serious topics, and they dicuss the serious topics seriously. They aren't just having the conversation for comedic value or making fun of them, they have the guests on who discuss the topic in a serious manner and attempt to answer questions that a normal person would have in a detailed and serious manner. Now I don't mean to suggest that they shouldn't be allowed to do that, because we live in a country with freedom of speech. However people may be forming their real opinions about these topics based on the conversations that are happening, and I question if that really is the best way for the ordinary person to form these opinions.

I think the uncomfortable place that I've landed at with these thoughts is that most people who passively listen to a podcast are really not criticially thinking about the information that they are hearing. In a sense, it's bypassing their filters and while the person may not immediately subsribe to the contents of the conversation, it surely influences the formations of underlying subconcious perspectives they have on these topics. To a certain extent, this makes sense. Do we expect every ordinary person who isn't an expert on a subject to dive into the literature and textbooks to understand the innerworkings and multiple perspectives that are present within a specific complicated topic? Of course that would be an upsurd expectation, considering how many interesting yet detailed and deep topics exist that impact us each day for which we desire some knolwedge, understand, and some type of answers or explaination. That's just human nature.

Even assigning some reasonable amoutn of responsibiility to the listener who wants to learn more, you could assume the answer is for them simply to listen to other podcasts or read other material that differs in opinion or conclusion from one another. However, the challenge here is that for detailed subjects such as scientific topics like COVID, the amount of foundational domain knowedge needed to even begin laying the differing opinions side-by-side in a way that allows for comparison is nearly impossible. For situations like this, it really would be wonderful if the experts who reached these conclusions themselves were able to discuss together the differences of their conclusions and have the ability to challenge eachother's assumptions and present this to the audience. One could argue that it still would be difficult for the listner, without the foundational knowledge in the domain of discssion, to process the different conclusions and reach a formed conslusion of their own. That is true, and I think to the degree for which a listener can follow along with the debate depends on the depth of the domain knowledge, and how attently the listener is actively processing the conversation and following along.

Regardless, I think the potential benefit of having a discussion live between two different experts is that at best the listener understands multiple perspectives and can more wisely form their own opinion, but at the worst they don't understand the topic but at the very least understand that there are multiple perspectives, and there isn't just one "right" perspective. I'm of the opinion that this is the best option because it still provides the passive-listening experience that most people look for when listening to podcasts, and it doens't leave the listener with just a singular unchallenged perspective to remember. The reality is that if a person is not actively comparing and contrasting different perspectives and ideas to construct their own opinions, then the best they can do (if they want to have an opinion about a subject they haven't done the work to understand), is to hear and regurgitate an opinion that they've heard online. And in most cases, we listen to people from whom we believe sound intelligent, are convincing, or just have a background that we trust. I'm of the position that it's best not to form or associate with strong opinions in subjects that we don't have the time or willingness to become knowledgable in, because the best that you can do is find an opinion that you think is the most intellegent opinion out there. But in reality you can't judge that opinion on the actual domain knowledge since you don't understand that, so you have to judge it based on other characteristics, such as the tone of voice, background of the person, how they present themselves, what other beliefs they have, or in the case of a news / information organization, what history they have with presenting vetted and accurate information. However that is not as relevant when lisetning to just a few people discuss a topic on a podcast.
