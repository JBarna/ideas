# Attempt 1
It's the night of November 8th, 2016, and millions of Americans are tuned into their media to witness the results of the 45th electoral compaign for presidency. Many had gone out earlier that day to the voting booths to cast their votes for their candidate of choice, most placing their vote between either the Republican nomine Donald Trump and the Democrat nomine Hillary Clinton. To the horror of many and the joy of just as many if not more, Donald Trump ended up running away with the election. And while half the voters celebrated and half grieved, we all couldn't help but wonder why these were the primary candidates up for election. Aren't there certainly better quallified candidates to be the leader of the United States of America? While that is true, I couldn't help but ask a deeper question that turned the spotlight back on ourselves and forced introspection: If we collectively thought the two top nominees were awful, why did they get 94% of the presidential votes?

Analyzing our decisions during the election requires us to become more introspective about the nature of human's decision making process, and how we reside with the conclusions and opinions of the world that we hold. To start, how are we supposed to decide which candidate we support? The intellectual and rational approach taught to us in school is to think for ourselves and construct our own hypothetical policies for which the nation could run. Then after we perform our own thinking, we survey the available candidates from the numerous political parties and align our vote for the candidate whos perspectives and views most closely match our own. That's what we should do in theory, at least. Realistically we all know that very rarely is this the way we actually vote, because to expect an individual who is juggling the complexities of every day life to additionally have the time to become well studyied in politics is unreasonable. So if not through our own thinking do we reach a decision, by which mechanism are we reaching a decision when we vote at the polling booth? And perhaps more importantly, how did this mechanism allow 94% of votes to go to choices that we deemed awful?

Without using first principle analysis to reach our own conclusions, the only remaining choice if we wish to have a perspective is to pick from the perspectives available in our media. This is what I deem the "shopping" method, where instead of procuring our own ideas, we simply select an idea that we prefer from the available opinions online, not much different from the way we choose which apple to take home from the bucket at the market. The shopping approach gives us a quick and easy way to find ideas, conclusions, and choices about the world around us.

# Attempt 2
The 2016 election was remarkable in so many ways, but certainly in that the two mainstream candidates were despised by so many Americans. Many of us rightfully asked ourselves how Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton become the front-runners in our presidential race. While there are important questions surrounding the process by which the candidates get selected and nominated in their respective political parties, I wanted to ask a deeper and more introspective question: If these candidates were so despised, how did they receive 94% of the votes for president? There must be some disconnect here between the goals of the citizen to pick a worthy candidate, and the actual decision making process used to select a candidate. 

So, how should we select a candidate? The intellectual and rational approach taught to us in school is to think for ourselves and construct our own hypothetical policies for which the nation could run. Then after we perform our own thinking, we survey the available candidates from the numerous political parties and align our vote for the candidate whos perspectives and views most closely match our own. That's what we should do in theory, at least. Realistically we all know that very rarely is this the way we actually vote, because to expect an individual who is juggling the complexities of every day life to additionally have the time to become well studyied in politics is unreasonable. So if not through our own thinking do we reach a decision, by which mechanism are we reaching a decision when we vote at the polling booth? And perhaps more importantly, how did this mechanism allow 94% of votes to go to choices that we deemed awful?

# Attempt 3
More responsible consumers source media that is known to minimize bias and perform thurough examinations of the topic, but most consumers don't maintain this standard and simply pick up news and perspectives through one-sided simplified content such as short articles or videos. While it may be a stretch to directly relate the current polarization within our country to the poor media habits of consumers, let's explore what implications we are able to derive from these habits and strategies to mitigate the more negative affects.

Without the time and resources to produce our own understanding of a topic from the ground up, individuals resort to the typical behavior of a consumer: shopping. They rely on perspectives presented to them through various online articles, videos, radio shows or podcast conversation, and over time will align themselves with the perspectives that they prefer. An interesting question to ask ourselves is that if the consumer isn't using rational analysis of the underlying topic to determine which perspectives they align with, what mechanism are they using? Consumers must use some other factor as a heuristic when determining the perspective that they subscribe to. Every consumer may have a slightly different set of underlying factors, but ultimately they congregate into what functions as a trustworthiness indicator. The more subjective trustworthy factors that a media source has, the higher likelihood that the consumer is going to align with the perspectives and conclusions presented from that media.


So what are these trust factors you may ask? Well on one side of the spectrum you have the more responsible media consumer who is using factors such as a history of journalistic integrity to select the media they consume. In the case of the media consumer with poor habits, they are certainly not using such high standards to identify trustworthy media. in fact, it's difficult to say exactly what the poor media consumer is really using to determine which media they find more inherently trustworhty, becuase it's often times not a concious activity. Trust factors could range widely from the way that someone articulates themselves, the culture someone represents, or just the persuasiveness of their presentation. 


- - -
To begin, let's break down exactly how we come to align with certain views and perspectives about the world. The first and typically unused approach is the tedious journey of researching the foundations of a topic and analyzing multiple perspetives ourselves from first principles to reach a perspective constructed from our own understanding. More realistically, without infinite time and resources, we search for media sources that provide these perspectives to us. I call this the "shopping" method, where instead of doing our own thinking to reach a conclusion, we rely on the perspectives presented to us through various online articles, videos, radio shows or podcast conversation. Shopping relies on going to a market, and in the current media climate the market can relate to either media organizations such as BBC or social media websites with user uploaded content. Not all markets are the same of course, and with media platforms being known for bias and attention seeking algorithms that create echo chambers it's important for the consumer to become exposed to different perspectives. Still, a critical question to ask ourselves is if we aren't thinking through the argument ourselves, what method are we using to base our decision on which perspective to subscribe to?



** EDIT: describe trust factors before the subconcious piece
It's tricky to isolate exactly which mechanism or reason we use over time to align with certain perspectives, but it's fair to assume that most often it's a subconcious alignment done over time with multiple exposure to similiar perspectives. Rarely do we listen to a podcast that has a new perspective and we react saying "Yes, this is what I believe now!". However it's undeniable that we do form beliefs about our surrounding world through the media and perspectives that we are exposed to. The question is, if this alignment is done without concious awareness, how do we align with certain perspectives over others? While it's difficult to put a finger on the exact mechanism, it's fair to say that our subconcious is picking up and judging different characteristics about the media source that we use to determine trustworthiness and our willingness to hold on or dismiss the views presented by that media source. These "trust factors" could range from more widely accepted indications of trust such as institutionally recognized credentials, to individual preferences the consumer has such as the way a presenter articuates themselves, their cultural background, other ideas they may hold, or simply the persuasiveness by which they lay out their arguments. Where do these individual consumer preferences come from? Considering they're subcioncoius it's difficult to say with any degree of certainty, but a safe bet is that these preferred trust factors reside in our past experiences and what we've witnessed to be worthy sources of information in the past.

The direct implication that subconcious alignment has is that it removes the ability for us to recognize the origins of the ideas that we hold. When we conciously construct an argument through logical analysis, we have a breadcrumb trail to reference when identifying the creation of our perspectives. When our opinions are 

# Attempt 4
In my previous article, we analyzed the relationship of podcast experts and the consumers who listen to them. The conclusion of the article led us to realize that while it's human nature to seek explanations about the world around us, we simply don't have the time and resources to become experts in these topics and think through to our own conclusions from scratch. As a result, we source information through consumer media or our social groups to provide us context and perspective to help us understand what is going on in our world. While we intuitively understand that shifting from being a producer to a consumer of perspectives isn't the most precise approach, certainly we have the intellectual capacity to identify a valuable perspective when we hear one. Or put another way, surely we will be able to navigate through the complicated mess of available opinions and emerge with similiar if not the same perspective had we done so by our own efforts. Yet if our value judgement for a chosen perspective does not rely upon the underlying fundamentals of a topic, what exactly is it based upon? How do we choose which ideas we subscribe to and which we dismiss without doing the analysis ourselves? Perhaps it is time to retrospect about the inherent trust we have in our own abilities to identify sources of trustworthy information, and from which we may descern the sacrifices to ourselves and our society that are made when placing unreasonable faith in this mechanism.

So what constitutes this internal mechanism which does the vital function of selecting which information we accept and which to dismiss? Let's begin by peeling the layers off this metaphorical onion and start with the first part that is easy to identify being the result of this mechanims, which is a signal of the trustworthiness of the source. If a source is deemed to not be very trustworthy, then the resulting information and conclusions presented by the source have little impact on our acceptance of that perspective. In the case where we deem a source as completely unhinged, we may dismiss the view altogether and stop paying attention. Of course the opposite is true as well, which is that when we receive the indication that this source is trustworthy it opens up our ability to receive and process the information we hear into our understanding of our world. So if this mechanism ultimately generates an indication of trust, what are the origins of our trust? Our ability to trust is inherent to our human experience and is a very core essential skill to survival in our world. Children grow up with innate trust in their parents, their school teachers, and their best friends as a result of necessity in order to navigate the world and grow up safely. In other words, the trust in certain people and social groups begins as an unquestioned mechanism for which our very existence relies on. As we mature other superficial characteristics inevitably weigh into our trust heuristic such as the way someone presents themselves, their charisma, or the common sensibility of their statements. Eventually as we reach the higher levels of our educational system we are introduced to the concept of performing concious analysis of a sources' integrity through evidence based work, and if we further specialize into a field of study we are exposed to the highest levels of intellectual rigour and verification. With this as the typical progression for an individual, and noting the latter parts of the journey are only available to a subset of individuals who continue through education, it becomes obvious that trustworthiness is a function that reaches conscious levels only when extra care and focus is applied. Now we might ask ourselves, what consequences does this subconscious mechanism have compared with the more intellectual and conscious approach? => from here, dive into ability to point elsewhere than our identity

The most apparent benefit of consciously analyzing a source's credibility is the ability to deliberately chooose the utilized trust factors. This choice allows for the inclusion of non-biased and rigorous trust factors which will more effectively result in a similiar end product, hopefully eliminating simplistic and biased one-sided media. The second benefit is that the consumer is aware of the path taken to choose their media and perspectives and has a direct reference of reasoning when their conclusions come into question. If challenged on their perspectives, they are able to present their previous analysis of the media and the contents of that media as the item in question. This characteristic may seem incedental but in fact it directly coorelates with our ability to separate ourselves from our ideas and in turn aids discussions with others. Individuals who disagree about a certain topic and have consciously understood their journey to arrive at their conclusions are able to compare the journeys themselves and search for the discrepencies that gave rise to the difference in perspectives. This offloading of the burden of proof allows for the deliberation to focus on the journey and not the individual who holds the belief. The conversation can remain cordjial even if impassioned, not dissimiliar to how homeowners might discuss the correct construction of a simple backyard project. In exteme examples, the owner of a particularly misguided journey may feel embarassed when it is shown to be flawed, but stil this is not an initial attack directly on them. 

Contrast this to the situation that arrises when the subconscious trust factors are used to consume information and arrive at conclusions. Where does the indivdual point to when questioned about their belief? There was no conscious construction of the journey, so the spotlight cannot shift away from the individual. Suddenly and perhaps by surprise, the person themself is in the hotseat. As with any situation where we feel attacked and under question, a defensive mechanism naturally emerges which brings up barriers and decreases our chances of being open to new ideas. Furthermore and certainly not helping the situation is the realization that there is no content to discuss with the other individual who holds a separate belief since there was no conscious construction or reasoning of the idea to begin with. As a result, there is no shared ground for which both parties can work upon to discuss their positions. Interestingly enough, even when using trust factors that we are aware of, the lack of common ground and the resulting conclusion of differance may still occur. In the situation where poorly chosen trust factors were utilized, the resulting information may still have substaintial bias and limited scope to the consumer. When two individuals who consumed substaintially different information meet with these misguided journeys, their sources of information may still be so biased that there is no commonality at all between their perspectives.

This lack of ability to identify even one point of shared common ground rises to what can only be seen as the natural conclusion, which is that their opinion is simply different than ours. With no similiaries, this forms a line in the sand that indicates those with shared perspectives and reasoning against to those with different. As our perpsectives narrow through subconscious or illchosen trust factors only two possible residencies can occur for further individuals we meet, which is to be placed into the "with me" basket, or discarded to the "not with me" group. This grouping from an individual perspective further enables the formation and acceptance of social groups that have clear borders since the dues of membership are simply subscriptions to commonly held beliefs. With our mainstream media options narrowing into persistent confirmation-bias echochambers and our subconscious trust factors built from those we trusted inherently for survival, it should not come as a suprise when the ideology of these groups has commonalities around culture, religion, geogrpahical origin, race, and ethnicity.

Let's begin by analyzing the experience of using aware conscious thought rather than subconcious. When we analyze a subject through deliberate rational thought and construct an argument based on that journey, we are left with a direct reference we can point to when questioned about our conclusions. If someone disagress with our perspectives, we are able to retreat  through the breadcrumb trail of previous thought and identify the point of divergance between the different conclusions. In the case where the perspectives that we hold resulted from the subconscious trustworthy mechanism, our reference to a chain of thought is nowhere to be found. When questioned about the origins behind our perspective, the reasons for why we aligned with a particular perspective appear a mystery to us. In this situation, the spotlight cannot be shifted away from ourselves to an external source of reasoning. Rather, we are in the spotlight.

This is an uncomfortable place to be, yet the consequences go beyond the normal situational discomfort of being caught emptyhanded. 

result of being in the spotlight ourselves has a direct affect on our ability to manipulate and discuss our ideas with others. When all interested parties can reference the trail of thought directly it allows for collaboration, similiar to how two homeowners might discuss a simple backyard project. When disagreeances occur, 



The responsible consumer would say that this conundrum has an easy answer - simply build a list of qualifying factors that judge a source's credebility and spend time analyzing the sources prior to digesting the information. This approach is certainly possible and in fact it's what was pointed out in our previous discussion as guiding factors that a responsible consumer can use when identifying a credible source. However, most individuals when consuming information either do not have this luxury of premeditated analysis or simply do not choose to do so when observing media. The reasons for this can vary, but it surely is an easy task to accomidate for in hindsight and one that is not very practical in the every day life of consumers. Ever since we were children we have been bombarded with information about the world from our parents, friends, cultural figures, religious institutions, media sources through radio, TV, or the internet, and we were never instructed to forgo the information without proper analysis of the source's credibility. **Only when we become young adults and we go through educational institutions that force to us to perform concious analysis of sources' integrity do we understand the intellectual process by which selecting credible sources is done**. Even with that education, humans cannot escape the sea of opinions about the world around us due to the social groups and the certain degree of unescapable media presence around us. It's no surprise that with this inudation of information and the very rare indication to us that we should be considering the factors of trust prior to absorbing that information, that we rarely do this. The average consumer, even consumers that are institutionally recognized with some essence of intellectual achievement as we will see an example of later, often fall into the trap of sidestepping the analysis of a sources' credibility.
