Joe Rogan has recently landed in hot water after Neil Young and other artists have publicly taken down their music from the Spotify platform after citing Joe Rogan's podcast as spreading 'mis-information' surrounding the COVID-19 virus. Critics are evaluating the situation from the right to free speech to cancel culture's reaction to the responsibility Spotify and Joe Rogan may have to provide accurate information to their audience. I've been following this drama carefully as I myself have listened to podcast episodes discussing the details of the COVID-19 from London Real, Valuetainment, Joe Rogan, and Lex Fridman. As I finished many of these podcasts I stumbled upon the uncomfortable truth that while I did listen to the podcast, I still didn't know much about the COVID-19 situation beyond the conclusions of the guest. While ongoing discussions about freedom of speech and overblown politicized reactions have full merit on their own, I couldn't help but wonder if we were missing a simple yet crucial underlying concern with the podcasting landscape. With the Joe Rogan controversy as a backdrop, it came time to ask the larger question: While these podcast conversations with experts are interesting, are they really helping us learn?
 
## Diving In
Since the beginning of podcasts hosts have been discussing complex subjects such as geo-politics, economics, healthcare, finance, and other areas with the goal of enlightening their listeners with knowledge and explanations they may have been unaware of. In order to better analyze their effectiveness let's break down these episodes into their respective parts and examine their merits. From the simplest point of view you have the host, the expert, and a conversation exchange between the two. Looking closer, the `host` will vary between being more debatefully engaged with the expert through challenge their assertions, assumptions, and conclusions to asking leading questions and allowing the expert to deliver their perspective untouched. The `expert` can vary on many factors but primarily through their credibility within the institutions of their field of study, and the closeness between their specific field and the topic being discussed.
 
Lastly, the `conversation exchange` is unique in two ways, structure, and automaticity. The `structure` of these episodes often do not have the same level of premeditated structure that a written paper, article, or presentation would have if given about the same topic. Conversations at best follow logically as the participants discuss the topic, but most often will have some variance where the participants may go off on a tangent or simply interact in a way that is difficult to follow by a listener. `Automaticity` comes into play when we consider that conversation exchanges are encoded in audio that is played back to us. When the listener loses attention or misunderstands a logical connection in the conversation, the listener's conscience must kick in and alert them that they are no longer following the logical connections of the conversation. An action is then necessary to pause and rewind the podcast to gain a proper understanding. That may not seem like reason for concern until one compares that with the experience through a written article or paper where the consumer must actively read and exert mental effort to consume the information presented. If attention is lost and information is not captured correctly, the following sections will make less sense until the reader will be forced to retreat to the point of previous disconnect. 
 
In the case of an audio playback, it is easy to switch from active listening to passive listening as the media does not stop when attention diminishes. Coupled with their unstructured nature and length, which can easily reach beyond two hours, the probability of a consumer still actively listening to the podcast at the end is considerably lower than the start. This switch from actively tracking a set of points and arguments to passively receiving information directly influences the degree to which the listener comprehends the topic internally and has the ability to reach conclusions based on their own understanding. With passive listening, the consumer may pick up on certain phrases, key words, metrics, or conclusions that are available in the podcast, but their ability to reach their own conclusion based on an underlying set of understood logical connections diminishes greatly.
 
This passive state of media consumption is not unique to podcasts or audio playbacks as it is of common practice in storytelling. Consumers commonly fall into a passive state when watching a movie, listening to a story, or reading a fiction novel. It's not a far stretch to argue that the quality of a story and the media construction of that story correlates with its ability to grip the consumer and bring them into a passive state of attention. How enjoyable would our experience with a movie be if we were so mentally active that we could continuously critique the film during its playback? Certainly gripping entertainment is something that we seek out but is it useful as a tool for learning complex topics? When is the time and place for passive media consumption, and do podcast conversations with experts fall into that category?
 
The reason we are comfortable going to the movies and suspending our active awareness is that we aren't concerned with the influence on our lives that an action movie is going to have. In the case of a podcast discussing something arbitrary to our lives, such as a cooking podcast or a true crime show, these topics are unrelated enough to be safely absorbed without critical thought for the sake of entertainment. The same can be said for complex conversations that are still distanced from our everyday lives, such as string theory. However I would argue that the line is crossed when the topics being discussed have perceived importance to the listener due to the opinions and values they hold about their surrounding world. In the case of COVID-19 this is easy to illustrate as we are all influenced due to the governmental and societal controls currently in place. We all have varying levels of underlying feelings and opinions surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic and the network effects that come along such as school closures, mask mandates, and political responses. When it comes to these topics for which we have opinions about and identify with, it is in our best interest to seek out good sources of information that challenge our biases and provide multiple perspectives so we can form our own conclusions based on our own understanding.
 
In a perfect world we would all have the time and resources to discover information and evidence regarding the topics that we care about, but of course this is not a realistic expectation. While most individuals spend the time becoming well knowledgeable in the domain of study where they perform work, they are unable to extend their expertise to other areas that affect them but aren't critical for everyday necessities. Short of becoming financially independent and actively researching the topics that affect you, what is there to do?
 
One simple answer is to forgo concern for those areas of knowledge, and focus on the things that you can actively control in your surrounding life. Why spend the time to have a nuanced and personal understanding of geopolitics when you can focus on your local community and enjoy time with your loved ones? This is indeed one approach, but there are a few challenges with this. First, sometimes these topics have just enough impact on our lives that it is necessary for us to have a deeper understanding. Topics such as our health and our finances have large controlling factors over our everyday lives, regardless if we have a desire to become informed. 
Another factor is the human desire to understand the world around us. Living without answers and explanations for the external events in our world is an uncomfortable place to reside. It is only natural to seek out information and explanations for the factors that influence our lives. With this desire to learn and the lack of time to do it, what is the appropriate answer? 
 
Journalists have long realized the necessity of providing quality information to consumers who don't have the resources to source the information themselves. Investigative journalists will research a topic from multiple perspectives and challenge experts who have reached different conclusions to see how they hold under scrutiny. The story is then presented to the consumer in a structured media format which provides both a storyline to follow along and the differing opinions juxtaposed so the consumer can judge the quality of the arguments and come to their own conclusions the best they can. While no journalism or research is perfect and without bias, this is arguably the best approach for a consumer who wants to gain sophisticated perspectives on a topic without doing the active research themselves.
 
Even though the consumer can't be reasonably held accountable for sourcing information themselves and doing the research, there is some responsibility for sourcing media that presents this information in a fair manner. The consumer should source from different media publishers to reduce the effect of bias, and then use the following questions as a starting point when selecting media that will help inform their perspectives on topics they care about:
 
- Does this media source have a reputation of non-bias and journalistic integrity?
- Does this piece of media share and compare differing perspectives surrounding the topic in question?
- Is the media structured in a coherent way that allows the consumer to follow along logically?
- Does the media have default automaticity or is the consumer required to pay attention to digest the information?
 
## Wrapping up
Coming back to our initial question, what do our conclusions about quality media and consumer responsibility imply about podcasts and their conversations with experts? 
 
While podcasts are certainly better than short-form opinion videos or politicized news articles, they aren't the most effective method for a consumer to construct their own perspectives. That being said, there are a number of opportune areas for improvement that podcast hosts could incorporate into their shows. First, more structure could be added to the episodes through introductory sections that cover basic fundamentals coupled with an ordering of questions to the expert beginning from simple to complex. Secondly, the host could do a better job challenging the perspective of the expert by bringing up differing conclusions and forcing the expert to respond in full. A more effective method that requires more understanding by the host would be to force the discussion to the initial point of divergence in the underlying set of domain knowledge so the listener doesn't simply juggle between conclusions. Of course the best option is providing a debate-like experience with multiple experts who hold different perspectives but this risks significantly changing the format of the media. Lastly, the length of the podcast conversation could be tailored for the average auditory attention span of the listener. While this is subjective, a safe bet of forty-five minutes to one hour may be the sweet spot for a podcast in both listener attention and topic exploration.
 
With those recommendations listed, does Spotify and Joe Rogan have a responsibility to improve the quality of the information in their podcast? Not exactly. Spotify is a business just like any other and is fully within its rights to produce media that gathers attention from a broad base of consumers, regardless of the quality of that content. Furthermore, Joe Rogan never stated that his intention with the podcast was to have high quality conversations with his guests. This can be represented as the majority of Joe Rogan's content is void from serious topics and is truly entertainment media for most individuals and in Joe Rogan's own words: "My point of doing this is always, just to produce interesting conversations, and ones that I hope people enjoy". Is it Joe Rogan's responsibility if listeners extract any further meaning from these conversations?
 
It's an open ended question, but parallels can be found with other challenges in our society. Take the obesiety crisis that America is facing with over 30% of American adults being obese. On one hand we have the freedom to choose the foods that we eat and on the other we have an industry that takes advantage of humans' evolutionary desire for fat, salt, and carbohydrates. With podcasting we have freedom of speech and the desire to understand the world around us. Is it both Joe Rogan's and McDonald's responsibility that their millions of consumers make healthy consumption choices? Perhaps not, but they should market their content honestly and consumers should choose what they eat and listen to wisely. When millions of Americans eat highly processed foods we shouldn't be surprised when the obesity rate increases. Similarly when millions of Americans form their perspectives about climate change, politics, economics and this pandemic through memes, short-form one-sided content and podcast conversations, we shouldn't be surprised when the rate of misguided and wild conclusions that the everyday citizen has increases either.
 
The uncomfortable truth is that regardless of our freedoms and where the blame lies, there is still an obesity crisis. Our society will bear that weight through healthcare costs, disability, and social security. And while it may be a stretch to call the current state of affairs an "information crisis", it's obvious something is happening with the polarization present within our country. At best society continues with citizens carrying significantly different perspectives that are unchallenged due to the media they consume, at worst, it's unclear how society will have to bear that responsibility. 
 
We can't control others, but we can control ourselves and the media we choose to consume. As with everything, we should make responsible choices. The same goes for your media habits. Thanks for reading.
