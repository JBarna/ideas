    <h1 id="attempt-1">Attempt 1</h1>
<p>It’s the night of November 8th, 2016, and millions of Americans are tuned into their media to witness the results of the 45th electoral compaign for presidency. Many had gone out earlier that day to the voting booths to cast their votes for their candidate of choice, most placing their vote between either the Republican nomine Donald Trump and the Democrat nomine Hillary Clinton. To the horror of many and the joy of just as many if not more, Donald Trump ended up running away with the election. And while half the voters celebrated and half grieved, we all couldn’t help but wonder why these were the primary candidates up for election. Aren’t there certainly better quallified candidates to be the leader of the United States of America? While that is true, I couldn’t help but ask a deeper question that turned the spotlight back on ourselves and forced introspection: If we collectively thought the two top nominees were awful, why did they get 94% of the presidential votes?</p>

<p>Analyzing our decisions during the election requires us to become more introspective about the nature of human’s decision making process, and how we reside with the conclusions and opinions of the world that we hold. To start, how are we supposed to decide which candidate we support? The intellectual and rational approach taught to us in school is to think for ourselves and construct our own hypothetical policies for which the nation could run. Then after we perform our own thinking, we survey the available candidates from the numerous political parties and align our vote for the candidate whos perspectives and views most closely match our own. That’s what we should do in theory, at least. Realistically we all know that very rarely is this the way we actually vote, because to expect an individual who is juggling the complexities of every day life to additionally have the time to become well studyied in politics is unreasonable. So if not through our own thinking do we reach a decision, by which mechanism are we reaching a decision when we vote at the polling booth? And perhaps more importantly, how did this mechanism allow 94% of votes to go to choices that we deemed awful?</p>

<p>Without using first principle analysis to reach our own conclusions, the only remaining choice if we wish to have a perspective is to pick from the perspectives available in our media. This is what I deem the “shopping” method, where instead of procuring our own ideas, we simply select an idea that we prefer from the available opinions online, not much different from the way we choose which apple to take home from the bucket at the market. The shopping approach gives us a quick and easy way to find ideas, conclusions, and choices about the world around us.</p>

<h1 id="attempt-2">Attempt 2</h1>
<p>The 2016 election was remarkable in so many ways, but certainly in that the two mainstream candidates were despised by so many Americans. Many of us rightfully asked ourselves how Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton become the front-runners in our presidential race. While there are important questions surrounding the process by which the candidates get selected and nominated in their respective political parties, I wanted to ask a deeper and more introspective question: If these candidates were so despised, how did they receive 94% of the votes for president? There must be some disconnect here between the goals of the citizen to pick a worthy candidate, and the actual decision making process used to select a candidate.</p>

<p>So, how should we select a candidate? The intellectual and rational approach taught to us in school is to think for ourselves and construct our own hypothetical policies for which the nation could run. Then after we perform our own thinking, we survey the available candidates from the numerous political parties and align our vote for the candidate whos perspectives and views most closely match our own. That’s what we should do in theory, at least. Realistically we all know that very rarely is this the way we actually vote, because to expect an individual who is juggling the complexities of every day life to additionally have the time to become well studyied in politics is unreasonable. So if not through our own thinking do we reach a decision, by which mechanism are we reaching a decision when we vote at the polling booth? And perhaps more importantly, how did this mechanism allow 94% of votes to go to choices that we deemed awful?</p>

<p>More responsible consumers source media that is known to minimize bias and perform thurough examinations of the topic, but most consumers don’t maintain this standard and simply pick up news and perspectives through one-sided simplified content such as short articles or videos. While it may be a stretch to directly relate the current polarization within our country to the poor media habits of consumers, let’s explore what implications we are able to derive from these habits and strategies to mitigate the more negative affects.</p>

<p>Without the time and resources to produce our own understanding of a topic from the ground up, individuals resort to the typical behavior of a consumer: shopping. They rely on perspectives presented to them through various online articles, videos, radio shows or podcast conversation, and over time will align themselves with the perspectives that they prefer. An interesting question to ask ourselves is that if the consumer isn’t using rational analysis of the underlying topic to determine which perspectives they align with, what mechanism are they using? Consumers must use some other factor as a heuristic when determining the perspective that they subscribe to. Every consumer may have a slightly different set of underlying factors, but ultimately they congregate into what functions as a trustworthiness indicator. The more subjective trustworthy factors that a media source has, the higher likelihood that the consumer is going to align with the perspectives and conclusions presented from that media.</p>

<p>So what are these trust factors you may ask? Well on one side of the spectrum you have the more responsible media consumer who is using factors such as a history of journalistic integrity to select the media they consume. In the case of the media consumer with poor habits, they are certainly not using such high standards to identify trustworthy media. in fact, it’s difficult to say exactly what the poor media consumer is really using to determine which media they find more inherently trustworhty, becuase it’s often times not a concious activity. Trust factors could range widely from the way that someone articulates themselves, the culture someone represents, or just the persuasiveness of their presentation.</p>

<hr />
<p>To begin, let’s break down exactly how we come to align with certain views and perspectives about the world. The first and typically unused approach is the tedious journey of researching the foundations of a topic and analyzing multiple perspetives ourselves from first principles to reach a perspective constructed from our own understanding. More realistically, without infinite time and resources, we search for media sources that provide these perspectives to us. I call this the “shopping” method, where instead of doing our own thinking to reach a conclusion, we rely on the perspectives presented to us through various online articles, videos, radio shows or podcast conversation. Shopping relies on going to a market, and in the current media climate the market can relate to either media organizations such as BBC or social media websites with user uploaded content. Not all markets are the same of course, and with media platforms being known for bias and attention seeking algorithms that create echo chambers it’s important for the consumer to become exposed to different perspectives. Still, a critical question to ask ourselves is if we aren’t thinking through the argument ourselves, what method are we using to base our decision on which perspective to subscribe to?</p>

<p>** EDIT: describe trust factors before the subconcious piece
It’s tricky to isolate exactly which mechanism or reason we use over time to align with certain perspectives, but it’s fair to assume that most often it’s a subconcious alignment done over time with multiple exposure to similiar perspectives. Rarely do we listen to a podcast that has a new perspective and we react saying “Yes, this is what I believe now!”. However it’s undeniable that we do form beliefs about our surrounding world through the media and perspectives that we are exposed to. The question is, if this alignment is done without concious awareness, how do we align with certain perspectives over others? While it’s difficult to put a finger on the exact mechanism, it’s fair to say that our subconcious is picking up and judging different characteristics about the media source that we use to determine trustworthiness and our willingness to hold on or dismiss the views presented by that media source. These “trust factors” could range from more widely accepted indications of trust such as institutionally recognized credentials, to individual preferences the consumer has such as the way a presenter articuates themselves, their cultural background, other ideas they may hold, or simply the persuasiveness by which they lay out their arguments. Where do these individual consumer preferences come from? Considering they’re subcioncoius it’s difficult to say with any degree of certainty, but a safe bet is that these preferred trust factors reside in our past experiences and what we’ve witnessed to be worthy sources of information in the past.</p>

<p>The direct implication that subconcious alignment has is that it removes the ability for us to recognize the origins of the ideas that we hold. When we conciously construct an argument through logical analysis, we have a breadcrumb trail to reference when identifying the creation of our perspectives. When our opinions are</p>

<h1 id="attempt-4">Attempt 4</h1>
<p>In my previous article, we analyzed the relationship of podcast experts and the consumers who listen to them. The conclusion of the article led us to realize that while it’s human nature to seek explainations about the world around us, we simply don’t have the time and resources to become experts in these topics and think through to our own conclusions from scratch. As a result, we source information through consumer media to provide us context and perspective to help us understand what is going on in our world. While we intuitively understand that shifting from being a producer to a consumer of perspectives isn’t the most precise approach, certainly we have the intellectual capacity to identify a valuable perspective when we hear one. Or put another way, surely we will be able to navigate through the complicated mess of available opinions and emerge with ultimately the same if not similiar perspective had we done so by our own efforts. Yet if our value judgement for a chosen perspective does not rely upon the underlying fundamentals of a topic, where exactly does it lie and upon what is it based? How do we choose which ideas we subscribe to and which we dismiss? Perhaps it is time that we retrospect about the inherent trust we have in our own abilities to identify sources of valuable information, and from which we may descern the sacrifices to ourselves and our socieity that are made when consuming others’ perspectives.</p>
