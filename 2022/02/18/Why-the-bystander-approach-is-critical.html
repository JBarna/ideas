<ul>
  <li>Selecting a conclusion</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>The “Shop” method, check for ideas that you like, pick one</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>The research + logical method, understand the underlying data, make your own decision about a conclusion</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The “Shop” method, how does it work?</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>(intro) Example of selecting a political candidate</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>What are you using to select the conclusion you want if you aren’t doing the logical work?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>You are most likely relying on other factors that are not themselves logical</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>The feeling you have towards the speaker, their credentails, their background, the way they talk</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>These are “trust factors”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>(weak) These feelings most likely come from your upbringing and what you identify with or you like for whatever reason (maybe)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>Our identity and subscribed conclusions entangle as there is no other underlying mechanism, like logic, that we can point to as reasons for our conclusions</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>This is done subconciously</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What implications does using the “shop” method have when discussing topics with others?</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>When others challenge our ideas we take personal offense to this because our identity is coorelated with our ideas. If someone disagress with your opinion, they’ve disagreed in some essense with your very being.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>There is no shared way of discussing the differences in the approach to reach the conclusion because the decision was not conciously rational in nature.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>(recognize positive path but don’t dive in ) The only way to reconcile your differences is to become introspective and ask yourself why you came to your conclusions, go back to the starting block, and try again rationally.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>Without introspection and overcoming our deffences, we simply categorize every other person as an “other”, since we don’t know why we choose the way we do and the way they do. We just know we’re different.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How this affects our interaction with social groups</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>Our attachments to these groups are based on intangible ideas and are thus correlated with our identify and feelings, creating a tribe like feeling.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>This “otherization” creates social groups and ideologies that form not based on the ideas but based on the underlying factors that people used to choose their ideas</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>These underlying factors may be things like race, culture, who we trusted growing up, etc.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>This could explain why there is substaintial division along those lines and why ideologies are commonly grouped with “isms”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How logical shortcuts are just as bad</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>So going back to square one, why not just become educated in these subjects?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>As previously discussed - this means listening to good media sources</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>But don’t fall into the trap of thinking that you can just “identify” intellectual sources</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>Surely an averagly intelligent person can identify a nutjob spouting off crazy conslusions, but are we using shortcuts to identify conclusions based on how intellectual or well thoughtout or common sensical someone is?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Story time of the physics story</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>The takeaway, if you are an expert, that means you should be able to do the actual rational work to reach the same conclusion, not be “smarter” at identifing if conclusions sound good or smell rotten</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>For the rest of us, if this type of human bias can affect experts, about a topic in their domain, about a conclusion that a different expert had, what does that say about our ability to identify conclusions based on the “rational” indicators of another “expert”?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <ul>
          <li>Basically…. we can’t</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>(tie in to earlier, not sure how to make this work) We now see ourselves as intellectual, so if we subscribe to ideas based on what we identify as smart ideas, then we see everyone else as stupid.**</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>First, how do we navigate this landscape going forward?</li>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>How necessary is it to have opinions on these topics?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>

        <ul>

<h1 id="thought-dump">THOUGHT DUMP</h1>
<hr />

<p>In fact beyond a general critique of the writing, I am extemely curious what you think about the arguments made around the automaticity of media and how that affects a consumer’s ability to construct their own ideas. In a way it’s analogous to a citizen who votes for a polictial candidate - some listen to the candidates and pick the one they like and vote for them. Others construct their own understanding of politics and then choose a candidate based on the similiarity of their views to their own. This is something that is really interesting to me in general which is, if you are the former individual, is there an argument to be made that you are less of an automnomous individual and more of a follower? And if you don’t make your decisions based on your own rational understanding of a topic, what are you making those decisions on? The way someone talks? The subconcious queues of an individual that for some reason, perhaps relatable to the individuals in your upbringing, you identify with that indicate a feeling to you that this is the person for which their conclusions you trust more than others? And if that is the case, is this also a potential root of social groups that form around different aspects of people’s inherent identity such as their origins, race, and cultural experiences? And ultimately what does it mean for the individual who subscribes to a conslusion without doing the forethought to reach that conclusion themselves - is their identity actually their own at that point, or is it part of the social group that subscribes to that conclusion? If someone disagrees with you about your conclusion and you’ve done the forethought to construct your own opinion based on logical reasoning, the typical response is to try and identify where in the rational reasoning the divergence occurs, so that you can better understand the logical foundataions that may lead you to a more formulated and responsible conclusion. When these disagreements occur, you are less inclined to see yourself as an opposer to the other individual, but instead see both individuals are attempting to reach the best conslusion based on their own atonomous understanding and exploration. However if you are the individual who shops around for a conclusion that you subscribe to based on subconsiouc queues that you may not conciously be aware of, when someone disagrees with you there is no underlying basis for which the dispute can be settled. The only reaction is simply an understanding that you two are not alike and perhaps as represented with our current polarization, that the underlying morals, thoughts, identities, and social alliances are additionally completely different. Its with this extension that we see the disagreeing individual as an “other”, or from the other side of the coin, not aligned with our own subconsious queues that brought us to accept one conclusion over the other available social opinions. But as I stated, we only see this person as an “other” if we ourselves reached the conclusions that we did through subconsious decision and not through concious deliberation of the underlying ideas and evidence presented. Wrapping it back up in the context of my original article, if we ourselves take more responsibility for consuming media that presents multiple perspectives alongside a decent explanation of the underlying fundamentals that those conclusions are based on, perhaps we can begin to reach a place where we see individuals with differing opinions as less of “others”, and more as a similiar individual to ourselves who is trying to reach their own understanding and conclusion as well. In effect, breaking down the perceived barriers between different social groups and uniting over individuality of thought.</p>

<p>There are a few different angles here - I am sure an anthropologist would take a look at this argument and debase the very first assumption, which is that we are even capable of being autonomous individuals with our own thoughts that are separate from the thoughts of our ancestors, relatives, and societies in general that influence our upbringing and life in general. Short of going into a full analysis of free will, it could certainly be argued that humans consume information from the environment around them and perhaps only in rare cases is there original or organic thought outside of the confines and influence of the society around those individuals.</p>

<p>Lastly, even when we do break down a topic into its fundamental parts and attempt to reconstruct those to reach out own understanding of the conclusion, how can we be sure that we are constructing the conclusion based on the logical merits of those underlying parts and not on some subconsious urge to use our personal experiences and influences to reach a certain conclusion? Are we always destined to be victim to the subcious thoughts and relationships we have or is it possible to break out of those and truly have a unique and individualist perspective based on logical analysis?</p>

<p>Furthermore, what does it mean to the individual to follow in the footsteps of others conclusions and what does it mean to think through ideas on your own and reach your own? How does this affect the individual and the way they see their relationships with the world around them, and how does it effect their identity?</p>

<p>Also, is it possible for individuals to participate in a society or social groups where they may feel connected based on certain merits but don’t associate with others, or simply obstain from subscribing to a perpsective. Does the attack on the “bystander” approach force individuals away from the ability to abstain from subscribing to perspectives and force them to align with certain conclusions, even if they haven’t actually thought through those perspectives themselves to create their own unique opinions, and perhaps those conclusions or perspectives don’t even have any dirrect influence into those people’s lives. And perhaps the groups that are trying to take power use these tactics to force people who normally would go about their day ordinarily without subscribing to opinions that don’t have influence on them directly to tip their hand and form alliances for the sake of gaining political power. But that comes back to the original question of what are these individuals sacrificing when they do allow themselves to subscribe to conclusions without proper analysis? Does that have a trickle down affect into the rest of their life? If they are persuaded into accepting an opinion without proper personal analysis, are they more willing to do that for other topics in their life as well? Does this demean the intellectual standards that our institutions attempt to set within our youth by enforcing the internal analysis of multiple perspectives and evidence prior to adhereing to a conclusion? Perhaps this is to broad of a conclusion to make, however if it is true then the push to leave the bystander areas and enter the arena even when one hasn’t reached an intellectual conclusion has a network affect of teaching individuals poor intellectual habits - as in, you can choose a conclusion without the proper work. Of course - at best, this person keeps those intellectual habits and simple makes the choice in the heat of the moment, being able to compartemantalize the unique decision and not let it affect the rest of their wordly analysis.</p>

<p>There are some implications here to explore. First, what does this mean for the individual, as we have already asked? Then, what does this mean for society and the social groups that we adhere to? What are the broader network affects and does this have a trickle down affect where individuals are unable to see eachother as individuals, but instead as associates of social groups and conclusions. Does this in turn create division?</p>

<p>As we previously discussed, it’s not a reasonable expectation for the ordinary citizen to have a formulated conclusion on every topic of importance, so what is there to do? As mentioned, there is the bystandard approach. And I would argue that the acceptance of this is actually incredibily vital to the inherent individuality that people have, and in turn affects their ability to comingle and meet eachother as individuals, not associates of subsribed group or tribes. Furthermore what happens when people actually do have the time and resources to become intellecutally aware of their world? Perhaps they are able to spread that message more clearly, perhaps it affects their decisions that could help others in their community either directly or indirectly that in general uplifts society (or could be used for direct mal-intent). The affect of that may dirrectly coorelate with the ability that individual has to affect change with that knoweldge. For example if you are an expert on biology but have no access to lab equipment or function, what is the use? But if you are in charge of a lab, you could potentially make a breakthrough.</p>

<p>What does it mean to jump to conclusions? If wea re critiqing an analysis, we would certainly call out a situation where the author did not lie down the credible evidence of logical connections to assert a particular conclusion. However when in the case of a regular individual who subscribes to a conclusion they hear, they are literally jumping to a conclusion themself by not having done any research on their own to reach that conclusion. If that is the case, then what is this really saying about that individual? And why are regular citizens allowed more often to get away with this when experts who construct those opinions are scruitinized? Additionally, if people subscribe to those conclusions, why are the subscribing? It comes down to some form of trust. They trust the institutions, they trust the scientific process, or like I had previously mentioned, perhaps they are relying on underlying subconcious queues that aren’t really based on any form of logical construction.</p>

<p>And maybe the polarization we are seeing isn’t really a critique of the conclusions that we have floating around in our society but instead a sort of representation of how different groups of poeple place their trust in different areas. The fundamental differences of the people in these groups is not the conclusions or thoughts that they adhere to but what they believe in that constitutes trust in the entities that provide these conclusions.</p>

<p>That is why it is so important to teach foundations of logical thinking surrounding empiricle and tangible concepts, from which individuals can build trust in the function of logical thinking and not just these subcionsou queues that tell us who to trust for our conclusions. And perhaps these foundations of logical thinking are actually what is in danger with the removal of the bystandard approach - it forces individuals to abandon that logical standard and instead jump to decisions and conclusions based on other underlying factors.</p>

<p>That being said, I think media producers are still able to take advantage of this logical thinking approach to thinking and learning. In some ways, it just trains people to associate more with someone who sounds like they are logically thinking rather than actually being logical. And then we are back to the subconcious queues. As an example, take this physisist who proved that this seemlingly counter-intuitative vehicle can exist, but was then absolutely discarded as a ridiculous individual by the very institution for which he was a part, and as a scientific institution, one that claims to render their conclusions based on logical analysis and not this subcionsous thinking. Yet here we have an example of where the natural fallacies of humans to rely on subconsoius queues to select conclusions rather than actual logical analysis took place, and it took place within a scientific institution by the people who are experts in this logical analysis about a topic that is in their domain. So if it can happen to them on a broad scale, what does that say about people who aren’t experts in a domain but have had some exposure to logical thinking but aren’t experts in a particular domain?</p>

<p>Well, it means that we’re back to square one. We are still using underlying queues to select conclusions that we may subcribe to more than others, but it’s just different subcionsous queues this time. We’re asking ourselves “what sounds logical?”, and “who sounds like they are well-grounded and understands what they’re talking about?”, when in reality, we aren’t doing any of the analysis for ourselves. Surely we think we are smarter than our ancestors who in our imagination of their primitive nature based their opinions on what clerics, priests, or their smart uncle had to say. Surely we are smarter than them. Surely we can identify when someone is blowing smoke and jumping to conclusions and hasn’t based their ideas on fundamental analysis. In short, I think this is the case. We are better at seeing the obvious nutjobs out there, the obvious conspiracy theorists, the obvious individuals who have grandious conclusions about the world that we live in but don’t have any factual basis for their conclusions or the ability to articule those perspectives in a way we deem logical. But then, there are the people who do have that ability. They have the ability to know more about a subject that we do and iterate that knowledge in a logical way that tricks our subcionsous queues into thinking that they have reached the correct conclusion, regardless of if the underlying logic actually holds. This how in the case of the ordinary citizen we are being tricked into believing stories and experts on podcasts like Joe Rogan where they discuss topics which are so complex that there is no possible way that we can ever validate ourselves if they are factually correct, but we think there is merit based on the underlying characteristics of the expert on the podcast, or just the person on the podcast. The same is extended to experts who live in a field where they have some much domain knowledge, but are still tricked by a logical truth that is unfortuatnely disguised as non-common sensical.</p>

<p>So what are the conclusions here? What are the takeaways? When we subcribe to conclusions that we ourselves haven’t done the research or logical analysis to reach, we are actually relying on underlying subconcious queues to identify trust factors in the entity that is providing these conclusions, rather than asses the logical analysis itself. When we subscribe to a concept based on these underlying trust factors, we make it difficult for ourselves to share commonalities with other individuals who disagree because it is unclear where the divergance of agreement comes from - it is not in the underlying logical analysis that is made conciously, instead it is in subconcious queues for which we may not have concious awareness of. This leads us to the only concoius reaction possible which is that this individual is just wrong, and they are delegated to not being “with me”. This in turn creates the “otherization” that we see currently within our present day society. Additionally, we preceive a disagreeance as an attack on ourselves and our identity, because we are not able to turn and point to the actual thing that we used to make this decision. Instead the decision was made on underlying factors that are just “part of ourselves” but hard to put a finger on, so the natural reaction is to take a position of natural defence to a differenc of opinion because the disagreeance is actually a disagreeance with the underlying factors that made us trust some entity, and these underlying factors are actually the very influences that make us who we are. When our identity goes un-analysed and we are unable to compartemanlize and label the reasons we are the way we are and chooose to believe or subscribe to the things that we belive, our only reaction is to take a difference of opinion as a personal attack. Perhaps a person who is well-versed in logical thinking would be able to instead become introspective and analys what brought them to that perspective in the first place, but that is not a given. And it is also a burden on the individual as we live our lives based on our identity and continuously unwinding the identity that we have which in turn allows us to operate in every day life is a very taxing excersize which can actually derail us from the very livlihood and habits that allow us to exceed or survive in our environment.</p>

<p>And as we learned from the example with the physists, even when we have performed logical analysis in a domain of knowledge, we are still able to be tricked into believe malformed conclusions based on underlying factors. Perhaps this is just inherent bias that we as humans have a responsibility to identify and build defences against if we truly wish to obtain only factual conclusions. Another perspective is to treat every conclusion or topic as unique - to not assume that we can levy previous understanding or conclusions, even in our domain of knowledge, as a shortcut to identify weak or correct conclusions.  Instead, especially in the case of a field that we are proclaimed experts in, we should be able to procure a complete logical analysis of the topic which exposes either the merit or falsehood of that topic. So that is the answer, but we can only do tha tin the areas that we are actually experts in , and ofc ourse we can also only do that in sreas of knolwedge that have empircal evidence or linear logicaly connections that formuatle the conclusions. It is not clear how this could work in areas of research that are so broad and still not understood where the only evidence that we really have are through the form of “studies”, such as healthcare and economics. And in the case of conclusions in areas that we aren’t experts in, well, we still have to interact with those areas in our daily life. Even if we don’t have the domain expertise in healthcare or economics, we still must interact with these domains and we still must make decisions in these domains which have direct affect on our life and our livelihood. What are we to do here? And this is the delicate balance of consuming wisely, having the understanding that while you are making your own decisions you are doing so without full knowledge and based on the integrity of the sources you choose, and taking everything with a grain of salt and realizing that you are still a bystander in a way. You are not the expert. You compartementlize your level of understanding</p>

<p>What is the takeaway for the individual reading this? It’s similiar as before - make responsible choices. Be an expert in what you are an expert in, and preferably be an expert in something that has grounds in either large amounts of empirical evidence or something where logical lineage can be made. When you come accross a topic in the area of your expertise, do not go with your gut on the merit of its conclusions, do the work yourself to analyze the contents and reconstruct the conclusion based on your own logical reasoning. For areas that are outside of your expertise, be comfortbale being a bystandard. Source as many different credible perspectives as you can and understand that adhering strongly to a particular perspective may actually be you choosing which trust factors you align with, and not the truth of the actual topic. As a rule of thumb, the simpler a topic is, and the shallowness of the underlying pool of knoweldge inherent ot that domain, the higher likelihood that you as the consumer will be able to make a conclusion based on the actual logical connections and not just the conclusion. Compare that with a much more complex topic such as this pandemic, healthcare, economics or politics, and you are most likely going to be making a decision based on trust factors and not on the logical conclusions themselves. Be careful of this. You can still listen to many different perspectives, but do this for the purpsoe of awareness. It is natural to want to be aware of the world around you, but that doesn’t mean that you have to jump to subscribing to certain conclusions.</p>

<p>What are tools that you can use in the current day and age to manage this? Identify when friends who are not as well versed in this meta understanding of conclusions bring up complex topics casually with the intent of discussing them. What will you actually discuss if you are not experts? At best you’ll ramble on about different points and just have some form of entertaining or conversation representing companionship, at worst you’ll start seeing eachother as either being aligned to the same or different tribes which could jeprodize the underlying companionship that is present and the initial factors that brought you into companionship. Focus on what you can control within your life and what you can be an expert on, and accept where those boundaries lie and be willing to abstain from conclusions in areas that you are unsure of. Be willing to be introspective on any conclusions that you may currently hold unknowningly that become surfaced through conversation, as those may be rooted in trust factors and not through actual logical analysis. Be willing to let go of these parts of your identity in the knoweldge that in doing so you are becoming a strong individual who is more capable of relating with other individuals.</p>

<p>One thing that I got away from me was what happens to the individual when you subscribe to other people’s ideas? I think this may be held off to the article on the futuristic thought expiriment, and what it means to actually be an individual who doesn’t follow others but creates their own ideas.</p>
